      <p>
        Civil Engineer turned Fullstack Developer. I love designing and building things, and Software Engineering has given me an outlet to use my creativity and problem solving skills. With my engineering background, Iâ€™ve really learned how to work as a part of a team. Whether that be as a teammate or a project manager, my experience working with others has been valuable.

        During my 4 years in college as a Mechatronics Engineer, I worked on multiple projects that consisted of using different software languages, including my senior capstone project where I was the hardware engineer and backup software engineer for a project working with Texas Instruments and the Department of Defense. With my time at General Assembly and Texas A&M, I've learned what it takes to be a successful engineer.
